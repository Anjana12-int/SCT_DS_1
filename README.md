#  Student Performance Data Visualization

This project is part of my Data Science internship. The main objective was to perform a basic data visualization task to understand the distribution of student performance scores using histograms.

##  Dataset

The dataset used is `StudentsPerformance.csv`, which contains information on:

* Gender
* Parental level of education
* Lunch type
* Test preparation course
* Scores in Math, Reading, and Writing

##  Task Description

* Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
* Created a histogram using `seaborn` to visualize the **distribution of math scores**
* Added a **KDE (Kernel Density Estimate)** to identify the shape of the distribution

## Key Insights

* Majority of students scored between **60 and 80** in math
* The distribution shows a **slight left skew**, indicating better performance overall
* KDE curve helped in identifying performance peaks clearly

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
